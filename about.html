  <div style="margin-left: 10%; margin-right: 10%;"><p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;"> Sydney Kit is a current undergrad student studying Art and Technology with the intention to specialize in Animation at The Ohio State University. 
    From an early age, she wanted to enter the medical field, just like most of her family. However, in her senior year of high school the counselor had told her that she was required to take an art class. 
    After several emails trying to convince the counselor to let her take a seventh science class instead, Sydney Kit was signed up for the art class. She found herself 
    in a situation where she was taking two art classes: a weekly news video class and a traditional art class. Throughout that year, she painted, drew, did an oil pastel drawing, and came up with a new video every week for the school to watch. Sydney Kit enjoyed the art 
    class more than expected and knew that art was a passion.  After graduating, Sydney Kit went to The Ohio State University, like both of her parents, with the intent of majoring in chemistry with a Pre-Med track. During the first semester, 
    she struggled to go to class every day because she knew that she wasnâ€™t where she belonged. After asking for help, Sydney Kit switched her major to Art and Technology. She was nervous, terrified, and anxious of the new changes in 
    her life but felt liberated and joyous about what was to come. After her second semester at The Ohio State University, Sydney Kit finally felt that she was going in the direction that she wanted.</p>
    <p style="font-size: 30px; text-align: center;">Now, she works on learning new techniques including digital painting, 3D modeling, and coding while still creating works by painting and drawing. She is the creator of <i>A Laney Day: The Series</i> along with the webcomic series <i>Love, Me</i>.</p>
