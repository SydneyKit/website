        <h2><b>Nap Time</b></h2>

<hr>
<p>That nap was well needed and refreshing. It's time to log on to my next class which is Film/Video 1. We won't go into detail becuase 
    we're just going to watch a movie. *Fast Forward* Now it's 6:30pm and the Columbus Blue Jackets game is starting soon. I do need to workout though... Which should I do?
