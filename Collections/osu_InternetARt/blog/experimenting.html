     <p>I have desperately needed a new website for a while now, so in starting Project 1, I had several things to think about:</p>
     <b><p>1. How did I want to present myself?</p>
     <p>2. How can I style a website that looks professional yet interesting?</p>
     <p>3. What should my logo look like?</p></b>
     <br>
     <div class="box">
         <div style="flex-shrink: 1.5;"><p><h3>Number 1</h3></p>
            <p>The answer to <b>number one</b> was easy: I wanted it all to look professional. I don't even have a definitive clothing style so how would I present myself and my personality if it is all over the place?</p></div>
     <div style="flex-grow: 3";><p><h3>Number 2</h3></p>
         <p> The answer to <b>number two</b> is still out there...if I find it I'll let you know, but if anyone out there knows, let me know!</p></div>
    <div style="flex-grow: 3";><p><h3>Number 3</h3></p>
        <p>I thought the answer to <b>number three</b> was this:</p>
    <img src="../files/SK_logo_ver1.jpg" alt="Logo Version 1 (Sydney Kit 2021)" style="height: 270px; width: 480px;">
        <p>But that apparently looked phallic to my High School Junior brother who ruined it for the rest of us... </p>
        <p>I have landed on this logo:</p>
        <img src="../files/SK_logo_ver2.jpg" alt="Logo Version 2 (Sydney Kit 2021)" style="height: 270px; width: 480px;">
        <p>I know I can always change it later but I just want to settle on THE ONE now.</p>
        </div></div>
        <br>
       
       <div class="center">
           <div><p>As an overall layout, I think I like this:</p>
        <img src="../files/SK_website_proposal_moodboard.jpg" alt="Website Mockup (Sydney Kit 2021)" style="height: 540px; width: 960px;">
        <br>
        <br>
       <p>As the layout goes I want it to be pretty straightforward and nothing too fancy since I am showing off all of my work and not just one style of work.</p>
           </div>
