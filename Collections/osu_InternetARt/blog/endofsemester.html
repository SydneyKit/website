     <p>Finals is right around the corner so that means, checking grades and calculating how much I need on the finals in order to get a good grade. However, this semester I am finishing up my last GE's and my grades are not what I would like them to be.
         No, they are not awful by any means, just not where I know I can be. That being said, I have accomplished so much in my field and that is how I will rememeber the semester (even if the meh grades hurt my pride now).

     <p>This past semester I have made several accomplishments in my field:</p>
     <br>
     <p><span style="padding: 0px 20px;"><a href="#anchor1">1.</a></span> I finished all the final edits of my comic this past week</p>
     <p><span style="padding: 0px 20px;"><a href="#anchor2">2.</a></span> The comic is currently in the process of being printed</p>
     <p><span style="padding: 0px 20px;"><a href="#anchor3">3.</a></span> Two (or three) of my works were accepted into a gallery show (More information later)</p>
     <p><span style="padding: 0px 20px;"><a href="#anchor4">4.</a></span> My work was featured in the Buckeye Boundary Breakers instagram account</p>
     <p><span style="padding: 0px 20px;"><a href="#anchor5">5.</a></span> I was finally able to create busniess cards after pushing them off for so long</p>

     <p style="font-size: 35px;"><u>I finished all the final edits of my comic this past week</u></p>
     <p>I had two (very filled out) Word pages of notes in order to finalize the edits of my comic. I had less than a week to have external (to class) critiques and complete the edits.
         I am actually impressed with how on top of it I was and that I didn't feel overwhelmed or stressed about getting the edits done. I did forgeto to turn in an assignment for a GE
         which doesn't help my grades guilt, but in the long run it'll be fine... right?

     <p style="font-size: 35px;"><u>The comic is currently in the process of being printed</u></p>
     <p>THE COMIC IS BRING PRINTED! I REPEAT! THE COMIC IS BEING PRINTED! I am so excited, yet so nervous I feel like I could throw up. Just like Anna from Frozen "Don't know if I'm elated or gassy but I'm somewhere in that zone."
         That being said, pre-orders are still open! Want a coupon code? <a href="owncomicbook.html">Check out the previous blog post!</a>

     <p>The Instagram is a new account but my work was one of the first published on the account! Check it out <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CNYtHY5pc42/"> here</a>! It features a page from my comic book that talks about ASL.</p>

     <p style="font-size: 35px;"><u>I was finally able to create busniess cards after pushing them off for so long</u></p>
     <p>Not as big of a deal, but still a big deal! I was finally able to figure out how I wanted my business cards to look.</p>
     <img src="../files/businesscards2021front1.png" style="width: 25%;"><img src="../files/businesscards2021back.png" style="width: 25%;">
     <p>It came in pretty quick! I ordered them on Wednesday and got them Friday! The print quality is okay, but everyone needs to start somewhere right? I was disappointed because the place I ordered the cards from 
         came highly recommended only for me to open up my order and some of the cards have spots on them.

     <p>See? Therefore, I think that it is okay that I do not get the prerfect grades I know I can get. Although, the GE's I am taking are writing and stats... both of which I am not good at to begin with......... Yeah, I have come to terms with my grade guilt.</p>
