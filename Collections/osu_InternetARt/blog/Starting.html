     <p>WELL WELL WELL, why did I not start off with HTML?? Why did I have to be thrown into a class that uses a NONBEGINNERS LEVEL CODE 
         as my introduction to coding?
     </p>
         <p>HTML has to be the easiest beginning code and my confidence is back up! Watch out hacking world, I'm coming for you! Just kidding
             I am getting WAY ahead of myself. Formating and basic stylistic choices of HTML/CSS has been a <i>fun</i> or dare I say <u>exciting</u>,
             no, I shall say <span style="color:red">colorful</span> experience. I also found out that I can embed sporitfy songs
             and videos so enjoy the song that is currently stuck in my head.

         <p>Why E.T. by Katy Perry? Because my partner hates me and decided to show me the following video. It won't play due to copyrights but please select "Watch 
             on Youtube" so you can also feel my pain.
         </p>
         <p>It's We Are Number One mixed with E.T., like, who would have thought? Well, someone did and now it is stuck in my head. Thanks, Tom.</p>
