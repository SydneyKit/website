     <p> Good morning/afternoon/evening/night or whenever you decide to read this blog. I have had a hell of a week. Imagine it was 
         midterm week but on drugs... that was my week. Between not being motivated with quaratine, seasonal, or whatever depression to 
         taking care of a physically aggressive drunk teenager there isn't much that I haven't done this week. 
     </p>
     <p>That being said, the roughness is shown in the following:</p>
     <p>I create A Laney Day: The Series videos every week, or at least I try to make them every week. It's been rough with my work
         schedule and personal that it just doesn't seem like I can still make one each week.

     <p>It's not awful but nowhere near the quality that I want it to be. I post these on my Instagram and I want to keep it consistent even though
         I have maybe ten active followers. Why do I do so much for so little? I appreciate their support and I don't take it for granted.

     <p>I have also been working on my weekly comics for my class and putting a lot of effort into them. I would share them here but I am
         planning on adding them to the full website when it's up.
     </p>
     <p>Speaking of the full website, this week also saw me cussing up html coding again and Tom having to fix everything. For example, I 
         added a video to my main page that would autoplay and it worked!! I had coded something and it worked!! AHAHAHAHhhhhh yeahhh no... It 
        worked once and then just stopped. Nothing changed in the code. I didn't even add a space. I just refreshed the page and boom CRASH!</p>

        <p>My life currently^^^ It's fine. It'll all be fine once this calms down, but today is not that day!</p>

        <p>As the saying goes, "so we beat on. Boats against the current. Borne back, ceaselessly into the past." </p>
