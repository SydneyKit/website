     <p>Throughout the semester I have been working on my own comic series for <a href="../../osu_Webcomics.html">ART 5890 Special Topics: Webcomics</a>  course titled "Love, Me".

    <p>So even though this past week has been an academic break week, I have been working nonstop on my comicbook!</p>
    <p>For class, only 10 comics are required, however to print the comic book I need 20 total pages (4 for the cover, 16 inside pages)! It has been a lot of
        work but will definitely pay off in the long run.
