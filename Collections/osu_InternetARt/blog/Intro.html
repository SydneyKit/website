     <p>Never in a million years would I think that having a Computer Science major partner would help me understand art.
         I had alwasy envisioned myself coding as one of those hackers you see in NCIS or spy movies, but an art class that 
         required me to use Arduino with no previous coding knowledge laughed at me. It wasn't a nice chuckle, it was a can't 
         breathe, red in the face laughing. I gave up on my dream to be able to understand how to code. A small glimmer of hope
         shined its light on me when Tom took an IT Fundamentals course that required him to code an html webite. "You forgot to
         close the bracket there" "you're missing a / there" I said to him as I sat on the floor, next to him in his chair. It 
         was 1:30 am, a time I usually do not get to see, and my head was spinning asking nonstop questions about how he was able
         to smoothly create this website. That is how I knew I had to give coding a try again! </p>
         <p>Well... that and I needed to take Internet Art to fulfill a requirement to finish my degree.</p>
