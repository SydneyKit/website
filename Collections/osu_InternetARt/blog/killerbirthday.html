     <p>Week Ten</p>
     <p>March 22, 2021-March 28, 2021</p>

     <p>March (and even February) has hosted several birthdays for friends and family so I have been in the ultimate birthday planning mode.
         I don't have any more birthdays to celebrate until.... June? July for sure... NO! The next is may. I have one birthday in April then three back 
         to back in May. Looks like I have one month (kinda) off.
     </p>
     <br>
     <p>Let's digest them:</p>
     <p>My gorgeous cousin was the first birthday in Febrary where we threw her a not-so surprise party.

        <p>My step-brother had a birthday, but I was not fortunate enough to celebrate in person.
    </p>
     <p>Then, the stunning sister was next. We just ate good food for a whole day. I gained 2 pounds and she probably dropped 2 pounds that lucky --

    <p>The day after was my uncle's in which we FaceTime'd for.
    </p>
    <p>After that, we had our first 21st birthday of the year.</p>

    <p>My partner-in-crime, my life partner, my dumbass, was next on the list. I already talked about <a href="springfake.html"> Niagara/Buffalo.</a></p>

    <p style="font-size: 20px;">^^ HOT DAMN</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Then, March hit and we had...</p>
    <br>
    <p>My grandma, in which I ordered her favorite bourbon and a gift bag with her favorite animal to be delivered. </p>

    <p>My tall as  f*** brother hung out with me for a weekend. (I didn't get a picture so enjoy this "high school boy poses in front of a mirror" picture of him.)</p>

    <p>Another 21st birthday happend, which just so happened to also be St. Patty's Day so we went SUPER early to beat the non-existant crowd at R-Bar.</p>
    <video controls src="../files/dennis_bday.MP4" style="width: 50%;"></video>
    <p>Then we had a wine & paint night celebration for a friend who had to move back home. The painting is mine, I didn't get a zoom picture of the other paintings.</p>

    <p>Now, I am getting ready to celebrate my grandpa's birthday by stuffing my freezer with 30 of his favorite sausages, making me look like a serial killer.</p>
    <img src="../files/freezer_bday.jpg" style="width: 45%;">
    <p>Since he lives closer than my grandma, we are fortunate enough to go down and grill them together. I am so excited because they are <a href="https://www.schmidthaus.com/"> Schmidt's </a>sausages.
    If you are not familiar with <a href="https://www.schmidthaus.com/"> Schmidt's </a>, once the buffet is open again, PLEASE go. It is SO GOOD. Keeping in mind it is only sausages and other German food.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>That being said, I am a killer queen at birthday surprsies and parties, but do not ask me for help. As you can see, my plate is extremely full.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Happy Birthday to those we have already celebrated and those who are coming up soon!!
