     <p>Before we get started, welcome to my rant. If you choose not to read everything, I'll skip to the end: I need your opinions on where my comic 
         should go. Please fill out this 30 second form: </p>

     <p>Onto the ranting!</p>
     <p>I have been working on creating this webcomic series called "Love, Me". It is a collection of advice from my friends and family showed in the daily lives
         of animals. It started off with this short comic:
     </p>
    <img src="../../files/Love, Me_dinah_SydneyKit.jpg" style="width: 60%;">
    <p>Now, I have 6 completed with this being my latest one (pre-critique and final edits):</p>
    <img src="../files/Love,Me_Catrina_withASL1.jpg" style="width: 60%">

    <p>I feel really proud of them and want to show everyone but I don't know how. I never thought that this series would be what it is now. I never thought
        I would be thinking about how awesome it would look on paper, yet here I am.
    </p>
    <p>I get likes from the same 20 or so people that regularly do (thank you times a million to those people) but I want more people to see them.
        I know that this might sound selfish but I really am just proud of what I am working on.

    <hr>
    <p>So, this week has been filled with comics and movies.</p>
    <p>Why movies you might ask?</p>
    <p>Becuase my partner and I are crazy and decided that we wanted to watch one movie a day for the entire 2021 year. We've been quite successful in watching 
        65 movies so far. (Today being the 66th day and we have yet to watch it.)
    </p>
    <p>You think I am joking? Here is proof:</p>
    <video controls src="../files/dahmermovie.MOV" style="width: 35%;"></video>
    <p>I will go into detail of the movies in a later post, but if anyone were to ask me what I did this past week all I can think of are comics and movies.</p>
    <p><i>WandaVision</i> is included in the comics and movies week but I am to far into theories that if I talk about it here and anyone were to ask my in person it 
        would be at least a two hour conversation.
